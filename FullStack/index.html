		<h4><a href="images/full.png">"Full" in Full Stack mean?</a></h4>
		<pre>
            Full means that you develop both the front end, and the back end.
            The front end is what the user sees on what is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)">client computer.</a>
            The back end is what is on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">server computer</a> that delivers content to the front end.
        </pre>				
		
       
 <h4><a href="images/stack.png">What does "Stack" in Full Stack mean?</a></h4>
		<pre>
            Stack means that several programs, a "stack" of programs is used.
            On the front end I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3">CSS3</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript.</a>
            On the back end I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a>.
            And I also have a LAMP stack on my server computer.
        </pre>				
		
       
 <h4><a href="images/lampstack.png">What does "LAMP Stack" mean?</a></h4>
		<pre>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> is a stack used for our web page server - remember, a server sends web pages to a client.
            LAMP stands for:
            L = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, which is the basis of our operating system
            A = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache</a>, which is our web server
            M = <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, the database we use <a href="">(click here for a visual)</a>
            P = <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php">PHP</a>, which is the programming language we use on the server side

		<h3>-- Start of Checkpoint 02 --</h3>

		<p>
			1. Explain DB: Organized way to save data on a server. LIFEBLOOD of all business, to track employees, customers, products, services, suppliers...
		</p>
		<p>
			2. Explain MySQL: Number 2 among the most-used DB's in the entire world! Oracle is number 1 because it offers professional support, but it is a paid service.
			MySQL is FREE! the inventor of MySQL named this after his first daughter, her name is "My."
			This same inventor later created MariaDB, after his second daughter "Maria."
		</p>
		<p>
			3. Explain SQL: Structered Query Language. MySQL is the name of the database, while SQL is the languyage you use inside of that database to answer
			questions -- like "which products are slow sellers..." SQL is an international standard language, works with MySQL, Oracle, SQL, Microsoft SQL Server,
			and many others.
		</p>
		<p>
			4. PHP is a programming language that connects front end to back end. PHP reads HTML forms, then sends that form info to the server. PHP also reads the database
			and sends that back to another HTML form. PHP is a server-side language, totally secure and private, you cant see PHP when you do da "view source."
		</p>

		<p>
			5. MySQL table: Has rows and columns, where data is organized in cells (rows are horizontal, columns are vertical). Looks like an Excel spreadsheet,
			but as you will learn it is actually very different.
		</p>
		<p>
			6. MySQL from the CLI (Command Line Interface) -- NTS, structure when done

			-- The User Interface for DB's are HTML pages that WE create
			-- The CLI is where experts, where the Power Users can inside of the DB
			but in a very primitive, non-GUI way. In other words, CLI is for the DB experts, not the users.
